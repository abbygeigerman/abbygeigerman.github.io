Itâ€™s time! One month ago I challenged myself to finish my current work in progress and send it to beta readers in 30 days. I am ecstatic (literally grinning as I type this) to announce that it is finally ready for review!

Whether you have beta read for me before, recently requested to beta read, or are here to get my author updates, Iâ€™m excited youâ€™re here :) If you are interested in beta reading this project, please respond to this email answering the few questions below. Nothing official, but here is a little blurb for some more information:

POTENTIA is a dark academia rivals-to-lovers novel about two family frenemies, Margot and Felix, who gain admittance to the most exclusive research university in the country. When they arrive in Potentia, the closed off capital city nestled in the heart of the mountains, they discover that not only do Potentians have groundbreaking technologyâ€”but that they can defy the laws of physics entirely.

Margotâ€™s ambition knows no bounds, and she will stop at nothing to get to the top. Felixâ€™s curiosity often drags him into unique predicaments, which, coupled with his general disregard for rules, makes Margot want nothing to do with him. But when they discover just how cut throat Potentia academics can be, they have to learn to work together or risk expulsionâ€”which now that they know the truth about magic, means they could never return home again.

Generally, I think this book will appeal to you if:

a) you were in a gifted kid program

b) you like reading about ruthlessly ambitious women

c) youâ€™ve ever been in bed and looked at the ceiling wondering what it would be like to walk on it

d) you like romance, ESPECIALLY pining

Questions for you:

When could you beta read by (98k words, ~400 pages)?
What are some of your favorite books?
Do you have any experience editing/writing? (not required!)
No worries if you arenâ€™t interested in this project, but if you are, I really appreciate your help and canâ€™t wait to hear your feedback ðŸ«¶ Also, if you know anyone else who might be interested, feel free to forward this to them!

Hope you have a great day!

Best,

Abby
