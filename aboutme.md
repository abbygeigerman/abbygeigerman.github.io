title: About me
---

In addition to being a writer, I’m a tea-loving hopeless romantic, active BookTok-er, cozy writing Youtube vlogger, and graduate from Rice University with a degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about writing fantastical, immersive stories and particularly love exploring diverse character relationships in grand magical adventures.

I just finished my first YA fantasy novel, *The Power of Shadows*, and am currently working on a rivals to lovers story set in a magical school where people defy the laws of physics.

My writing tends to include a lot of feet-kicking romance, powerful women, unique magic systems, atmospheric locations, found families, and complicated family dynamics. I am also a sucker for enemies to lovers, rivals to lovers, or any variation of the two!

Some of my favorites include Babel by R.F. Kuang, Seven Days in June by Tia Williams, A Court of Mist and Fury by Sarah J Maas, and The Atlas Six by Olivie Blake. You’ll never catch me without a beverage in hand (usually tea, coffee, kombucha, or any combination of the three) and at least one or two books within reach. I have shelves, but I still insist on stacking them on my desk like a dragon hoarding treasure. Please contact me if you have any book recommendations!
